I ride a dark black The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwRdyXkyFGk">Honda CBR 150R Streetfire</a>.The Honda CB150R StreetFire is a CB series 150 cc (9.2 cu in) single-cylinder standard/naked bike made by Astra Honda Motor in Indonesia since late 2012. It is positioned above the more economical Verza in Astra Honda Motor's sport motorcycles lineup.It think that my favourite uncle had a similar one when I was a child.My uncle was not a good looking guy,but he looked very cool with his bike.When I saw The Honda CBR 150R Streetfire in a bike shop 3 months ago,I fell in love with her .I felt that she was saying,"Get me,please."I ride her everday to commute.The best season for riding a bike is spring.I can feel comfortable warm wind against my face and enjoy the cherry blossoms beside the highway.I can't live without my hobby.

		Riding a motorcycle gives riders a sense of freedom on the open road. However, there are serious dangers involved in riding without a helmet.Motorcyclists need to take extra precautions to protect their body. The most important place to start is by protecting the head.In 2012, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated 1,699 lives were saved because individuals wore helmets.Even when a rider takes all possible precautions, accidents resulting in injury still occur. When you or a loved one are involved in a motorcycle accident leading to serious injury or death, you will need a lawyer experienced in personal injury law to help you navigate the legal options available to you. The lawyers at Mainor Wirth stand ready to consult with about the details of the accident and provide legal advice based on your individual case and needs.
