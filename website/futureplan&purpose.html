<h1>My Future Plan & Purpose</h1>
<p>
Every man has an aim in life. A man without an aim is like a ship without a rudder. A fixed aim helps a man to succeed in life. Great men in the world had their fixed aims in life.

Different men have different aims in life. Some want to be high officials or scholars or poets etc. Someone wants to be engineer or teacher etc. <br> <br>
My aim in life has always been to become a successful software engineer.Because I am a student of Department in Computer Science And Engineering.<br> Software engineering is highly respected in the field of information technology as almost every field is connected with computers these days.

The role of a software engineer becomes crucial in tapping the available sources to provide the best solution for issues faced.

Software engineering will help me in understanding my dream of making it big in the severe competition involved in the business market. It has become possible to realize my aim in life without foregoing my career choice.<br>
